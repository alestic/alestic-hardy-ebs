This repository contains the code used to build the
Ubuntu 8.10 Hardy EBS boot AMIs listed on http://Alestic.com

These AMIs are built with exactly the same filesystem images
that Canonical uses to build the official instance-store AMIs
for Ubuntu 8.10 Hardy.

Instead of using this code, you are welcome to simply run the
public Ubuntu AMIs listed on http://Alestic.com

This code is provided so that the way that these AMIs are
built is transparent.
